There is a one possibe injection in the code. See where I had used 'os' module, its not a big issue 
but you can remove that from your code if you are highly concern about the security of your system.


IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR PRIVACY SAFE FROM GOOGLE, USE SYSTEM PROXY OR VPN SERVICES

[WARNING]{
You all are not supposed to use it somewhere else on your name
but you can copy the code and use it on your system and commit changes in program according to your need
